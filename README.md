# Simon Says Game Project

Inspired from an electronic game of short-term memory skill invented by **Ralph H. Baer** and **Howard J. Morrison**, working for toy design firm Marvin Glass and Associates, with software programming by Lenny Cope. The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. [Source](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)>)
